# Seq-Tools

A set of tools to aid in the analysis of high-throughput data in genomes. The heart and soul of the package is found in the Class Gene.py. This is a class that exists for every gene (and every splice isoform - limited as they are in *S cerevisiae*) and defines all the necessary and important parameters.
